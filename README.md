## 🎯 Objective:

It's focused on evaluating revenue based on diverse parameters like state, month, and age, aiming to provide key insights for strategic business decisions.

## 📈 Tasks and Visualizations:

- **🗺️ Revenue by State:** A "Revenue for State" map visually represents sales data across states. The varying color intensities indicate the sales volumes, offering a geographical snapshot of revenue trends.

- **📅 Revenue by Month:** We've developed a time-series chart, transforming month data into a date format. This chart is instrumental in uncovering revenue trends over different years and quarters, revealing seasonal patterns and growth.

- **👥 Revenue by Age:** This chart explores revenue distribution across various age groups, shedding light on demographic preferences and buying patterns.

## 🧮 Data Types & Measures:

- Identified Dimensions (string values) and Measures (numerical values) for a structured analysis.
- Total Revenue is meticulously calculated using the formula: `(Price * Quantity) - Discount`.

## 💻 User Interface:

- Utilized Tableau’s user-friendly drag-and-drop interface for all visualizations.
- Enhanced the visual appeal and readability through strategic formatting of labels and colors.

## 👀 Target Audience:
Ideal for marketing teams, research departments, or executive management, this analysis serves as a valuable tool for informed decision-making.

## 📁 Data Sources:
The project uses data from a CSV file, including detailed columns like SKU, Total Value, etc., providing a rich dataset for analysis.

## 📝 Additional Notes:

- The analysis spans Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive methodologies for a comprehensive view.
