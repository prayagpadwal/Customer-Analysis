Objective:
The project aims to perform customer analysis using Tableau, a business intelligence tool specialized in data visualization and analysis. The primary focus is on evaluating revenue based on different parameters like state, month, and age.

Tasks and Visualizations:

Revenue by State: Created a chart titled "Revenue for State" that uses geographical mapping to represent sales data. The intensity of color correlates with the volume of sales.

Revenue by Month: Generated a time-series chart where the data type for the month was converted to a date format. The chart allows users to explore revenue trends across different years and quarters.

Revenue by Age: Developed a chart to analyze how revenue is distributed across different age groups.

Data Types & Measures:

Dimensions (string values) and Measures (numerical values) were identified.
Total Revenue is calculated as (Price * Quantity) - Discount.
User Interface:

Tableau's drag-and-drop interface was used for all tasks.
Additional formatting was applied to labels and colors for better readability.
Audience:
The target audience for this analysis could be the marketing team, research team, or executive management.

Data Sources:
The data was sourced from a CSV file and includes multiple columns like SKU, Total, Value, etc.

Additional Notes:

Three main types of analysis can be considered: Descriptive, Predictive, and Prescriptive.
Tableau offers 44 different types of charts, ensuring that the most effective visual representation is chosen.
